The planet, called Axanar, is the first <span class=\"s8\">of </span>three orbiting the type <span class=\"s15\">KO </span>orange dwarf star Delta Orcus. The planet&#39;s dis­ tance from the.star is slightly less than 0.9 <span class=\"s25\">AU </span>and has less orbital eccentricity and axial tilt than Sol Ill,or Terra.</p><p class=\"s9\" style=\"padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;\">According to Ensign Fortine, the star does not produce as much radiant energy as the sun we are <span class=\"s34\">used </span>to, making the climactic conditions livable, <span class=\"p\">but </span>harshly cold in comparison to Terra. Also, its tilt and 11at&#39; orbit make the seasons much more alike than on Terra. They are always cold. The other <span class=\"s36\">two </span>planets in the system are gas giants similar to Jupiter (Sol V) or Behemoth (Alpha Centauri II), though Delta Orcua Ill <span class=\"s8\">does </span>have an exceptionally beautiful ringformation.</p><p class=\"s9\" style=\"padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;\">Everyone on board is tremendously excited <span class=\"p\">by </span>the find. The only thing that could have <span class=\"s19\">been </span>better would have been encountering natives as peaceful and friendly as on Alpha Centauri.</p><p class=\"s9\" style=\"padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;\">After attaining orbit and using the ship&#39;s ground radar to check for life, Idecided <span class=\"s19\">to </span>order the ship <span class=\"p\">doWft </span>to the surface. Chief Engineer MacGregor reported all systems were operating perfectly, <span class=\"p\">and </span>Fortine was dispatched with a team of crewmen <span class=\"s36\">to </span>study and eventually make contact with the natives.</p><p class=\"s9\" style=\"padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s8\">As </span>reported in his own <span class=\"s19\">log, </span>Fortine suffered casualties after meeting with the Axanarians. For the record, Ido not hold him responsible in any way for the <span class=\"s34\">loaaes. </span>He is an exemplary officer and, so far as Iknow, <span class=\"s19\">acted </span>in complete accordance <span class=\"s8\">with </span>both regulations and common sense.</p><p class=\"s9\" style=\"padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;\">After laboriously teaming the Axanarians&#39; fairly simple language, Fortine was induded into their society and exposed <span class=\"s36\">to </span>their culture&#39;s religious and philosophical beliefs, which include the sacrifice <span class=\"s19\">of </span>natives. When the time came for him <span class=\"p\">to </span>leave, circumstances forced him to promise to return one day. Only <span class=\"p\">by </span>so promising could he guarantee the <span class=\"s36\">safety </span>of himsel andthe others in his <span class=\"s19\">party.</span></p><p class=\"s9\" style=\"padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 25pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;\">Iam very excited by the potential wealth in minerals and resources of this newly-discovered <span class=\"s19\">world. </span>H Ihave any reservations at all, they refer <span class=\"s36\">to </span>the hostility <span class=\"s36\">of </span>the native population. Also, I am slightly uneasy with the ethics <span class=\"s8\">of </span>Ensign Fortin• making a promise he could <span class=\"p\">not </span>keep. A deliberate falsehood is hardly the ideal foundation for building aculuralrelationship.</p><ul id=\"l2\"><li style=\"padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 19pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;\"><p class=\"s9\" style=\"display: inline;\">There is no <span class=\"s8\">doubt </span>that we have had a tremendous <span class=\"s34\">impact </span>on the culture <span class=\"s8\">of </span>Axanar.

Their skin color is somewhat pale due to blood V88881s being deeper below the skin, the cone and rod eye cells interpret visible light differently, <span class=\"s8\">and </span>internal organ arrangements are not like anything Ihave seen before, <span class=\"s8\">but </span>these are minor variations.

On Stardate 115105.02,</p><p style=\"padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">a personal warp-driven shuttle made cxmtact with the <i>USS Sentry </i>near Gamma Demetrius. An alien warship calling <span class=\"s9\">it­ </span>sen the <i>Devisor </i>of the Klingon Empire demanded the return of the shuttle and its passengers. The <i>Sentry&#39;s </i>commander reluctantly honored the shuttle pilot&#39;s request for temporary political asylum, and shots were exchanged briefly between the Federation and Klingon ships. The <i>Devisor </i>then de­ parted, promising to return and wreak havoc on the Fed­ eration and its citizens. This was the first contact with the hostile government of the Klingons, a race who seemed to enjoy combat sheerly for its own sake. Over the next sev­ eral stardates, an assortment <span class=\"s34\">of </span>contacts and brief skirmishes were reported between individual Federation picket ships and Klingon pirate vessels near the disputed Klingon/Federation border.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">The second major encounter occurred on Stardate 1/6003.04, when a Klingon starship, modified to transmit a Federation scout identification signal, seized the <i>USS Flying Fortress, </i>a slow but heavily-armed prototype transport. By means of a sneak attack, the Klingons were able to destroy the transport&#39;s bridge, killing all command personnel and rendering weapons systems inoperative. The ship also happened to be carrying the first experimental deflector shield, although the Klingons never did discover that fact. Even though the ship was temporarily in Klingon control, a successful interception <span class=\"s16\">by </span>a Federation anti­ piracy task force forced the Klingons to release their tractor beam, returning the badly-damaged <i>Flying Fortress </i>to Star Fleet&#39;s control with all its secrets intact.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">These increasingly unrestrained acts of piracy and combat by the Klingons greatly concerned Star Fleet Command and resulted in emergency appropriations to construct two new Star Bases near the Klingon Empire. Star Bases 22 and 23, completed in Stardate 1/6401 and 1/6905 respectively, would serve as centers of operation for Star Fleet&#39;s task forces protecting Federation space and shipping from further incursions by Klingon vessels. After the attack on the <i>USS Flying Fortress, </i>there were no multi­ ship confrontations between Klingon and Federation vessels until the Four Years War began. Occasional skirm­ ishes and exchanges of fire between vessels of the two governments, however, would continue.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">One notable period of remarkable inactivity lasted from Stardate 1/82 to 1/87. The popular belief is that it was due to a war being fought <span class=\"s52\">by </span>the Klingon Empire along another border. Though there is no knowledge of any intel­ ligent race on the Klingon Empire&#39;s coreward border, the covert discovery of massive Klingon shipbuilding efforts during this period would seem to reflect some form of open warfare with an enemy other than the Romulans or the UFP.</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s53\" style=\"padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;\">UFP SOCIOPOLITICAL BACKGROUND</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s18\" style=\"padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">From <span class=\"s16\">Psychohlstorlcal Study of Known </span>Space, Academician Sir Kenneth A.F.

The establishment of the United Federation of Planets on Stardate 0/8706.06, with its charter permitting the creation of a Star Fleet Command, went a long <span class=\"s17\">way </span>to ensure safety of lives and property within Federation space.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Still, there were limitations. Technology and the anti­ matter warp drive had opened up space, but eve&#39;n warp drive could not do the impossible. Advances in propulsion permitted speeds of up to Warp 3.5, but no higher. Significant breakthroughs in interstellar travel would not be forthcoming until the discovery of dilithium in Stardate 117603.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">After the inconclusive Romulan War of Stardate 1/0610 to 1/0909, peace again became the watchword within the Federation. After outposts along the Romulan border became operational in Stardate 111804, the Federation could expand without significant difficulties, and began to grow complacent. Research continued on the de­ sign of a practical materializer beam (later called the transporter), but funding for Star Fleet operations was re­ duced dramatically.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">In Stardate 113612, the Federation Council voted against appropriations for a totally new generation of warships. This, coupled with the monumental design failure of a later ship class, resulted in an obsolete, 46-year-old destroyer class serving as the Federation&#39;s first line  of defense when first contact did finally come with the Klingon Empire on Stardate 115105.02.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">In Stardate 1/5708, a political body calling itself the Terra-Return League was formed on Benecia colony. The goal, as described in their Proclamation, was to end the Federation&#39;s <span class=\"s16\">policy </span>of expansion and have all Humans re­ turn to the Sol system from the most outlying regions of</p><p style=\"padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">space. Observing ttiat mankind had gone deep into space and still had not solved <span class=\"s17\">many </span>of Humanity&#39;s basic problems, the League felt resources were being explorted and abused on an interstellar level. They said room enough existed on the   now-habitable   worlds   of    Mars,   Venus,   Ceres,</p><p style=\"padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">Ganymede, and Titan, <span class=\"s9\">and </span>so the Federation should be disbanded, <span class=\"s9\">and </span>Terra observe a strictly isolationist view <span class=\"s9\">of </span>extra-solar activities.

The scandal involved a request made to the Federation for specific economic trade protections. Th&#39;allt, a small Andorian colony world very close <span class=\"s19\">to </span>numerous Tellarite trading worlds, claimed harassment <span class=\"s9\">by </span>particularly exploitive Tellarite traders.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">The situation, code-named •Archimedes• <span class=\"s19\">by </span>Star Fleet, was ignored at first and later badly mismanaged <span class=\"s19\">by </span>the Bureau of Interstellar Commerce.

The truth is that after the Romulan War, we grew as fat and complacent as a Sirian bandersnatch after feeding. The Federation was un­ beatable, its military forces were all-powerful.

Once in­ stallations were ex&gt;mplete along the Romulan border, the future role <span class=\"s19\">of </span>Star Fleet Command seemed limited to navi­ gational and simple law enforcement duties. <span class=\"s19\">As </span>a result, appropriations for Star Fleet Operations were cut sharply. Funds for research and development permitted only modest technological improvements. Funds for new ex&gt;nstruction allowed only for the replacement <span class=\"s19\">of </span>vessels no longer safe for use. At one point, plans for an·entirely new generation of combat vessels were submitted to Star Fleet, but the Council rejected any further expenditures.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">This went on until Stardate <span class=\"s34\">1/4802.20, </span>when the first of a new class <span class=\"s19\">of </span>cruiser was commissioned. The <span class=\"s12\">USS Tritium </span>was the  first starship designed with three warp nacelles. According to Zephram Cochrane&#39;• original warp theories, no more1han two warp nacelles could <span class=\"s19\">be </span>used <span class=\"s12\">on </span>a single ship, because Imbalances In the warp fields gen­ erated  <span class=\"s9\">by  </span>the  nacelles  would  nullify  the  drive&#39;a  <span class=\"s9\">effect.</span></p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p style=\"padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Several flag-rank officers in Star Fleet Engineering Command disagreed. They believed the third nacelle would stabilize and harmonize with the performance of the other <span class=\"s36\">two, </span>dramatically increasing maximum operating perform­ ance. Many billions of credits were put into the project, and a total <span class=\"s19\">of </span>six <span class=\"s16\">Tritium </span>Class ships were construded before the project was terminated. Simply put, Cochrane was right,</p><p style=\"padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">and the theoretical enginee were terribly wrong. Many officers had staked their careers on the decision and later found themselves out of a<span class=\"s19\">job.</span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">On Terra, the ships in the ancient nautical fleets were built around the size of the guns or the thickness  of the armor.  However, the overriding limitation on the efficiency</p><p style=\"padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">of a starship is not the hull material or the size of its turrets. With these ships-of-the-line, <span class=\"s36\">it </span><span class=\"s8\">la </span>the warp drive that serves to power all other systems. After the failure of three warp nacelles on a single ship, efforts continued to increase the</p><p style=\"padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;\">efficiency of the warp drives themselves. These efforts re­ sulted in steady progress, as the maximum ship-speed crept slowly upward to Warp 4.8. The <span class=\"s16\">Mann, Rickenbacker, </span>and <span class=\"s39\">Baton </span><span class=\"s16\">Rouge </span>Classes, among others, contained im­ provements over earlier designs, <span class=\"s8\">.but </span>additional substantial progress would <span class=\"s19\">be </span>limited until dilithium became a component inwarp drives.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Tactics continued to develop as well, with Star Fleet ships usually working in groups of three or four similar ships, allowing convenience in repair throughout  the growing Federation sphere of influence. In many ways, the situation near the Klingon Empire was Ideal for starship crews. There was enough excitement was possible to keep officers   alert,  and  the   brief   conflicts   gave   numerous</p><p style=\"padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 48%;text-align: justify;\">commanders at least some combat experience. Many of the lessons learned <span class=\"s56\">m </span>minor confrontations served to train</p><p style=\"padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">them better than any simulation at the Academy could. <span class=\"s34\">(Of </span>course, the historical simulations at Star Fleet Academy were second to none, but no amount of simulation can substitute for actual field experience.)</p><p style=\"padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">Another source of pride for Star Fleet was the newly­ established Marine Academy, opened in Stardate 1/9009. This new institution would provide Marine Corps Command personnel with the specialized training needed for their particular duties. And now that they had their own edu­ cational <span class=\"s8\">and </span>training facilities, a special sense <span class=\"s19\">of </span><i>esprit de </i><span class=\"s55\">corps </span>could be imparted <span class=\"s19\">to </span>them as well.

When things nearly go sour at Babel Conference and even other Humans want to return to home, they blame poor economy. For Archimedes Crisis, they blame ethics of truly honorable Tellarite merchants.

This pressure, combined with the need for territorial expansion and conquest of additional resources, led to combat.  To fully understand the implications <span class=\"s8\">of </span>this, it is necessary to know something <span class=\"s19\">of </span>Klingon politics.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 25pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;\">Members of specific, powerful lines <span class=\"s19\">of </span>ancestry serve as the rulers in the Klingon Empire. <span class=\"s8\">If </span>the ruling position on</p><p style=\"padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;\">policy <span class=\"s19\">la </span>opposed vehemently enough <span class=\"s8\">by </span>other lines, important members of the ruling family are assassinated, and the assassins become the new ruling line.

Unless the Empire&#39;s Immediate future would be damaged <span class=\"s34\">by </span>multiple assassinations, Kllngona would continue to employ tactics <span class=\"s19\">of </span>this nature to change policy, even duri    wartime.</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p style=\"padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">More than four decades <span class=\"s34\">passed </span>between the time <span class=\"s19\">of </span>the Initial encounter between the Klingon ship <span class=\"s12\">Devisor </span>and the <span class=\"s12\">USS </span><i>Sentty </i>and <span class=\"s19\">the </span>beginning <span class=\"s8\">of </span>the Four Years War.

As a result, the Klingon Imperial Forces turned coreward, apparently seeking an Inexpensive <span class=\"s34\">but </span>meaningful gain in territory there. Pr88umably, from what little information we have, their <span class=\"s8\">efforts </span>were sharply thwarted <span class=\"s34\">by </span>another race or races occupying that region of <span class=\"s19\">apace. </span><span class=\"s8\">As </span>casualties mounted in &quot;The Unknown war•, the High Command was forced to</p><p style=\"padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;\">reconsider their <span class=\"s15\">strategy. </span>There was also pressure on Klingon leadera to  launch  a full-scale  attack  against the</p><p style=\"padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;\">Federation, in hopes of a fast and inexpensive conquest there.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 25pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: justify;\">For a number of years after the conclusion of  The</p><p style=\"padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">Unknown War, other family lines began to show extreme</p><p class=\"s57\" style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;\">r</p><p style=\"padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">displeasure at the Emperor&#39;s apparent cowardice, and threatened open warfare against the High Council itself. It is believed the abortive sneak attack against the Federation transport <span class=\"s12\">USS Flying Fortress </span>resulted in extreme embar­ rassment for high-level officials <span class=\"s19\">of </span>the Klingon Empire. <span class=\"s8\">They </span>began to search elsewhere for glory and conqu88t until enough time had passed and their failure forgotten. The lack of success on the coreward front refocused Klingon attention on the adversary  judged to be less dangerous; i.e.,the Federation.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">The High Council planned an unexpectedly bold and rash plan of offense against the Federation, in the <span class=\"s34\">hopes </span>of mollifying their enemies and remaining in control. Their goal was to·seize and annex a large region of space currently under Federation control. Once that was accomplished, they could then turn their energies to the Romulan Star Empire and a region <span class=\"s19\">of </span>space known as the Triangle. Assuming the Federation would relinquish control over the disputed area rather than enter a prolonged conflict, the war could beover in afew months with minimal casualties.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Though there apparently was concern among the High Command over the Klingon Empire&#39;s ability to wage a prolonged war, <span class=\"s19\">it </span>was not deemed  likely that such a war would last for more than <span class=\"s36\">two </span>years. The Klingons believed that a massive ship construction program begun about five years prior to the commencement of hostilities would give the them a quick victory through overwhelming fleet superiority.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Another faction, however, had other plans that would have added considerably to the overall suoceaa of the primary goal. Their intention was to send a Klingon squad­ ron secretly into the Federation, occupy a planet, construct a surface naval installation and complex fortifications, and operate within Federation space as <span class=\"s34\">long </span>as poaaible. This would serve as a diversion, provide an Installation with some limited repair facilities, and add to Star Fleet&#39;s con­ fusion. After enough time <span class=\"s34\">passed  </span>for the first Klingon squadron to reach Axanar (their chosen planet), a eecond squadron would be dispatched immediately, <span class=\"s34\">provided </span>no word came from Star Fleet of the first squadron&#39;s detection or destruction.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: left;\">Apparently, they received information from non­ Klingon sources regarding the location and nature <span class=\"s19\">of </span>Axanar. An interdicted world under the protection of Gen· eral Order Number One, Axanar was unusual in having such</p><p style=\"padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">a status so close to the center of Federation space. The Klingon High Council must have judged this planet to be an excellent site for their military installation, provided the shipe could successfully reach the <span class=\"s34\">planet </span>without being detected. Using enormous fleet maneuvers and the unpro­ voked massacre at the Arcania Four Research <span class=\"s34\">0utpoat </span>as strategic diversions, the Klingon Imperial Navy task  force was able to secretly reach Axanar.

The idea of using Axanar, a planet very deep within Federation space, as the site for a Klingon naval base must have some logical basis in fact. Even Klingons generally tend to think in logical terms when the subject is strategic military policy.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">There are hundreds of planets closer to the Klingon border that would have been more suitable for purposes of supply, defense, and general operations. For an advance base, a planet a few parsecs distant would have been more logical than having <span class=\"s8\">It </span>40 or 50 parsecs behind enemy lines. Such great distances would change the most routine of supply missions into the greatest of undertakings and be terribly wasteful of resources.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">I have compiled a new theory that is based on an analysis of the genetic structure and the primary personality characteristics of every major Humanoid race living in the area <span class=\"s8\">of </span>Federation space between the Klingon Empire and the planet Axanar. The statistical analysis and subservient processes took a little over 17 years (and consumed just under 33,000 tablecloths, at last count).</p><p style=\"padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">After carefully evaluating the general personality of the Axanarian race and the available genetic data on both Klingons and Axanarlans, it appears they may be slightly more alike in their DNA structure than any other Humanoid, includln   Humans.  An        sical similarities should not be</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p style=\"padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">considered disparaging toward the loyalties of Axanarians in general. On the other hand, they did ally themselves to the Klingons, though that too may have been obtained through chemical or biological coercion.</p><p class=\"s9\" style=\"padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 26pt;text-align: justify;\">If <span class=\"p\">this is the case, it is possible the primary purpose of taking Axanar was to establish some sort of complex biogenetic  installation there.  Its purpose might have been to flood surrounding Federation territory with a Kling­ on/Axanarian genetic hybrid. Such a half-breed would pro­ bably have the general appearance </span>of <span class=\"p\">Humans but the motivation, training, an resources </span>of <span class=\"p\">Klingons.</span></p><p style=\"padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">With the secondary motive of building and maintaining a large spaceship base on the surface of Axanar, the Klingoris could <span class=\"s8\">proceed </span>to fight the war while successfully establishing a covert hospital/research facility on the surface for future use. Now is, <span class=\"s9\">of </span>course, the future when viewed from the time of that war.

Our first lesson this time would come at Arcanis.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">Star Fleet Command maintained a medium-sized research outpost on Arcanis IV, an otherwise uninhabited Class K planet. The station was manned by a mixture of military and civilian technicians working on a wide as­ sortment of low-priority projects. There were no extensive offensive or defensive weapons systems at the base aside from assorted personal side-arms, and patrols In the area</p><p style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s35\">were </span>generally limited to an occasional <span class=\"s12\">Hale </span>or <span class=\"s12\">Bode Class</span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;\">scout.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">On Stardate 1/9212.21, the <span class=\"s12\">USS Bohr, </span>while on standard <span class=\"s19\">patrol, </span>reported observing a three-ship Klingon task force in the area <span class=\"s9\">of </span>unclaimed space between the UFP and the  Klingon Empire.

The last message recorded on the base&#39;s log was from a Klingon marine Captain named Muthar who remarked that the base would not be destroyed, &quot;because it might someday <span class=\"s9\">be </span>useful to His Excellency, Emperor Karhammur.&quot; The cost in Federation lives was 112 In all. They were the first to die, <span class=\"s9\">but </span>they would not <span class=\"s34\">be </span>the <span class=\"s19\">last.</span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 25pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;\">And <span class=\"s19\">this </span><span class=\"s34\">attack </span>was only the beginning. <span class=\"s19\">On </span>Stardate 1/9301.25, the <span class=\"s12\">USS Rutherfon:J </span>detected a Klingon battle fleet <span class=\"s9\">of </span>over 100 ships <span class=\"s8\">within </span>the neutral area. They were moving  just   spinward  <span class=\"s9\">of  </span>the  Rigel  system,  apparently</p><p style=\"padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">heading Into Fedetratlon space. Star Fleet Intelligence quickly learned the fleet, code-named &quot;R&quot;, was under the oerall command <span class=\"s9\">of </span>Klingon Admiral epetal Kazu, an officer with some reputation for making quick, violent decisions. On Stardate 119302.24, the <span class=\"s12\">USS Irwin </span>detected an almost Identical force under Admiral zantai Kone.  Code-named</p><p style=\"padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;\">group &quot;U&quot;, the ships were moving spinward of Star Base 22 with the same apparent intention of violating Federation territory <span class=\"s12\">en masse.</span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">These discoveries had a devastating effect on Star Fleet Command. Although most scouts nearest the Klingon border maintained their proper surveillance positions and promptly reported their findings, we had no effective way to deal with the situation once we did know about it. Star Fleet Intelligence, Klingon Sector, had kept track of general activities and trends, and they knew about many Klingon shipbuilding programs, including a massive construction project involving several hundred <span class=\"s12\">D-7 </span>cruisers. They did not, however, expect these new forces to be used against the UFP, but instead anticipated their deployment else­ where. The Klingons had constructed large fleets between Stardate 1/82 and 1/87, and our best guess was that they would use these new ships inthe Unknown War.</p><p class=\"s36\" style=\"padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 25pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;\">It  <span class=\"p\">appeared  that  the  Klingons  had  massed  their</span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">enormous battle  fleets for a frontal attack on the Fed­ eration. In defense, all UFP vessels capable of combat were transferred from Star Bases 21, 14, and 15 toward the border sectors. Meanwhile, Federation and civilian crews rushed to finish the new ship-building docks and assembly plants on Star Base 15, should the unthinkable actually happen and open hostilities <span class=\"s9\">be </span>declared.</p><p class=\"s36\" style=\"padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 25pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;\">It <span class=\"p\">was  some time before we teamed there was  a</span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">second purpose for the attack on Arcanis and the two-fleet thrust against the Federation. <span class=\"s19\">As </span>Fleet Captain Garth proved, these actions were to cover a nine-ship task force leaving the Klingon base at -Ruwan, moving past Star Base 14 through the heart <span class=\"s9\">of </span>Federation space to reach the interdicted world of Axanar. Preoccupied with mobilizing our forces against the Klingon Fleets, we suspected nothing at the time.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Then, in Stardate 1/9305, both Klingon fleets radically changed course and reduced speed from their previous average of Warp 6 to Warp 3. By this time, the enemy armadas were just outside Federation territory in the no­ man&#39;s-space between the Klingon and Federation borders. This action admittedly left Star Fleet in a real quandary, as squadrons continued to form in support of any necessary defense.                         ·</p><p style=\"padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Star Fleet was not the only confused group of leaders. The Federation Council had only the single atrocity of Arcanis on which to base the declaration. After closely comparing the relative strength <span class=\"s9\">of </span>the Federation against the Klingon&#39;s current force, the Council sorrowfully wrote off the lives of the destroyed research outpost in closed chamber decisions. Not having an adequate motive for starting a full-scale war, the Federation elected to ignore the losses suffered, and <span class=\"s52\">hoped </span>they would bethe <span class=\"s19\">last.</span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 26pt;text-align: justify;\">Nothing further happened for a number of months. Eventally splitting up into a number <span class=\"s9\">of </span>smaller squadrons, the Klingon fleets continued to travel in unclaimed space, sending shivers up the spine of  Federation task group commanders facing the treacherous enemy. Our hands would remaintied until Stardate 119406.15.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 26pt;text-align: justify;\">Fortunately, the Klingon fleets did not force a major action until late in 1/94. By that time, Star Base 15&#39;s huge new shipbuilding docks were ready to go into immediate, full­ scale production, with other bases equally torqued up to handle conflict.</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s37\" style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">THE DECLARATION OF WAR</p><p style=\"padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;\"/><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s16\" style=\"padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;\">From  <span class=\"s12\">Star  FIHt  Command  ON/clal  Cllmpalgn History of th• Four Yea,..

Though it <span class=\"s38\">was </span>a little un­ usual for so much time to pass between transmissions, the scout was not yet  officially listed as missing in action. Captain Garth, however, knew that the ship was supposed to be at Axanar. By combining both pieces <span class=\"s19\">of </span>data, Garth concluded that something had somehow gone wrong, and that this Klingon ship might be involved.</p><p class=\"s9\" style=\"padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Realizing the tactical situation as well as the distance of this unfriendly vessel within Federation space, Garth engaged the <span class=\"s12\">D-4, </span>ordering its commander <span class=\"s36\">to </span>surrender. When the vessel attempted to activate shields <span class=\"s8\">and </span>Initiate combat with the <i>Xenophon, </i>Garth used superior tactics to disable the Klingon&#39;s warp engines with skillful laser fire.

By this time, Garth and the <i>Xenophon </i>were already on their way <span class=\"s34\">to </span>Axanar at Warp 6.2.</p><p class=\"s9\" style=\"padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s19\">As </span>soon as word of the <i>GuHlvels </i>fate reached the Federation  Council,  a  declaration  was  prepared  and</p><p class=\"s9\" style=\"padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">transmitted on all major hailing frequencies <span class=\"s34\">to </span>the com­ manding officer of the Klingon task force at Axanar. He was given a choice between withdrawing his entire force to the Klingon border while under Star Fleet escort and outright surrender.

He complained good-naturedly about the duty, considering it to be &quot;just another scouting mission&quot;, but on Stardate 1/9408.29, Garth got much more than he had bargained for. Though the Klingons bottled up within the Axanarian system had made <span class=\"s15\">no </span>attempt to leave their current position, a second Klingon task force containing <span class=\"s15\">two </span>squadrons of <i>D-4E </i>auisers <span class=\"s15\">as </span>well <span class=\"s15\">as </span>numerous <span class=\"s34\">cargo </span>freighters <span class=\"s8\">and </span><span class=\"s24\">8888Ult </span>ships, was reported <span class=\"s19\">by </span>one of Garth&#39;s <span class=\"s15\">acouts. </span>This squadron was moving in toward Axanar, apparently intending to reinforce and resupply the existing Klingon naval <span class=\"s36\">garrison.</span></p><p class=\"s9\" style=\"padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Badly outnumbered, outgunned, and unprepared for a full-sca e fleet <span class=\"s36\">action, </span>Garth proved his resourcefulness. He gave very detailed instructions <span class=\"s34\">to </span>all starship com­ manders, and quickly split up his small command Into three. One group of ships formed a trailing U-formation <span class=\"s34\">to </span>conduct a fixed defense, and the other forces maneuvered away at high warp speed.</p><p class=\"s9\" style=\"padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">The Klingon task force moved in, pinning the first group and crippling several Federation scouts. Meanwhile, Garth&#39;s second group conducted a massive, subspace communications counterintelligence operation, simulating the subspace radio traffic of several large Federation fleets moving in to encircle the Klingons. The Klingons, closely monitoring Star Fleet communications were fooled. They immediately broke <span class=\"s8\">off </span>their attacks against the first group and reformed for asecond attack.</p><p class=\"s8\" style=\"padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">As <span class=\"s9\">the ruse progressed, the Kllngons believed the &#39;fleets&#39; were closing in on them. The third task force now moved into covert attack positions. Once there,they suc- cessfully directed laser and eccelerator cannon fire against the unshielded aft sections of more than half the Klingon force, quickly knocking out a majority of the affected ships&#39; propulsion systems.</span></p><p class=\"s9\" style=\"padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Three of the lightly-armed and shielded Federation scouts were destroyed and four destroyers (including the Xenophon) and the auiser <i>USS Bonhomme Richard </i>were badly damaged.

Passing into Federation space, they  viciously attacked any Star Fleet forces encountered. During this time, the decisive Battles of Andromeda, Genmarx, Lea, and Lyclydun were fought, and Jannl IV was subjugated by regiments <span class=\"s19\">of </span>Klingon soldiers in the first ground action <span class=\"s19\">of </span>the war. The Kllngons· showed some weakness in tactical skill, but tended to make up for it in numbers, often forcing a three- or four-to-one  numerical</p><p style=\"padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">superiority over defending UFP cruisers and  destroyers.

Robert April, Commander <span class=\"s19\">of </span>the <span class=\"s16\">USS Enterprise, </span>retired. Quietly unhappy with Star Fleet&#39;s handling of the Arcanis incident and unsatisfied with the strategic withdrawal of Federation forces in the Klingon onslaught, he felt a more aggressive approach could, and should, have been taken to repulse forces of the Klingon Imperial Navy. Though not a trouble­ maker by nature, he found the current situation disturbing enough to realize it was beginning to alter his performance as a commander. While <span class=\"s9\">I </span>disagree with April&#39;s position, <span class=\"s9\">I </span>respect him for having had the personal honor and respect for duty to resign from Star Fleet when he knew he was not serving at peak efficiency. <span class=\"s19\">Of </span>course, he is still serving as ambassador-at-large, a position he has filled with the same degree of skill he showed as a starship Commander.

We could only hope their old animosity toward the Klingons would be enough to get them on our side. Until we were sure, forces had to <span class=\"s19\">be </span>stationed on that front as a precaution. This seri­ ously hindered any chances we might have had of stopping the Klingons.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Combat continued between Stardates 119504 and 119507, as the Klingon fleets continued <span class=\"s19\">to </span>advance into UFP territory. The Battle of GR-1 and the Assault of Nozseca VIII were <span class=\"s36\">two </span>significant setbacks for Federation forces, though marines on Nozseca under Andorian General Shruth put up a valiant defense as they attempted to engage orbiting spacecraft with limited surface-based, anti-space weapons. The defending Federation squadron <span class=\"s19\">of </span><span class=\"s16\">Portsmith </span>and <span class=\"s16\">Nelson </span>destroyers and scouts had been destroyed, damaged, or chased <span class=\"s19\">off, </span>gMng the Klingons uncontested ground attack capability  from orbiting gunships. After the defending forces were eliminated through ship-based disruptor attacks, Klingon soldiers landed. Although Kling­ ons did garrison the planet, no Federation ground forces survived to defend, and so this is not considered a genuine marine action against enemy ground units.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Meanwhile, one significant surprise awaited the Klingons, one of the few bright spots at this point in the war. On Stardate 119504, a convoy of Orion merchant ships heading for the. Federation manufacturing facility on Alphosa was intercepted by a Klingon destroyer task force near Laxala. The convoy, carrying supplies of partially-re- fined dilithium, was vital to the Federation&#39;s war efforts.  The</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p style=\"padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">Klingon group leader apparently knew it, and demanded the cargo <span class=\"s19\">be </span>turned over. As one merchant  ship closed in to make a cargo transfer, the Orion captain deliberately over­ loaded his warp drive. This totally destroyed his ship and one Klingon destroyer and severely damaged a second destroyer, thus endingthe attack.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">A formal pronouncement came from the Orion government shortly afterwards, stating that all shipments of dilithium to any government would be treated as &quot;sacred cargo, not to <span class=\"s19\">be </span>captured, diverted, or destroyed by any government until after reaching its declared  destination.&quot; The Orion official also announced that the Rigel XII dilithium mining complex had been equipped with enough anti-matter to vaporize the planet, which is what they would do if anyone tampered with any future dilithium shipments, anywhere. <span class=\"s8\">As </span>no one was willing to call their bluff, and be­ cause dilithium was the one essential element for modern warp engines, the Orions&#39; conditions were unamiously accepted.</p><p style=\"padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">availability  of  plentiful  unrefined  metals  and  its  central location within Federation space.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">At this time, Star Fleet also began production on two new classes of starships: the <span class=\"s16\">Achernar, </span>and <span class=\"s16\">Tikopai. </span>These ships would be superior to their Klingon counterparts, and production rates were high enough to give some hope <span class=\"s9\">of </span>combat parity against them.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s9\">It </span>is unfortunate the <span class=\"s16\">Achernar </span>and <span class=\"s16\">Tikopai </span>Classes were not modified to use the newer phaser and photon torpedoes after their development.

The docks at Star Base 15 were now fully ope,rational, and other major shipyards were quickly adding to the Federation&#39;s available forces. Plans were already in the works for the future construction of new shipyards, especially one within the asteroid belts of the Thranstor · system. Because Thranstor had two belts, both composed <span class=\"s9\">of </span>iron-nickel asteroids,  it was selected for its</p><p style=\"padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">and gunboats on piracy duty discovered the convoy.

The <span class=\"s16\">USS Defiant </span>and a Federation cover squadron of <span class=\"s16\">Baton Rouge </span>Class cruisers destroyed .or captured all eight Klingon vessels, once again proving the general superiority of Federation tactics in any situation where numerical odds did not overwhelmingly favor the enemy.</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s37\" style=\"padding-left: 124pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">HOLDING THE LINE</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s12\" style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s16\">From  </span>Star  <span class=\"s36\">Fleet  </span>Command  Campaign   History   of the Four Years War, <span class=\"s16\">John </span>Gill and <span class=\"s16\">the Star FIHt Offa of Public Affairs and Information.</span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">On Stardate 119509.07, after experiencing an in­ creasing number of starship disappearances, Star Fleet ordered the establishment of a Zone <span class=\"s9\">of </span>Transport Escort. The movement of private and commercial starships was restricted and certain mandatory requirements placed on all flights. The Zone covered the area from New Paris to Daran V, and would be in effect until the war&#39;s end. Though this action was unpopular with many, it had the immediate effect of reducing the number of lost starships.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">During Stardate 1/9511, the Nostveg Engagement took place, marking the first time substantial numbers of <span class=\"s16\">Loknar </span>and <span class=\"s16\">Tllcopai </span>Class warships fought in a single battle, and proving the worth <span class=\"s9\">of </span>these new ships. Successfully ex­ ecuting a multiple-tier, straight-line  assault against a horde of disorganized trailing V-formations, Star Fleet&#39;s Eleventh, Twenty-Eighth, and Thirty-Second Strike Squadrons de­ feated five Klingon squadrons. This was the first strategic defeat for the Klingons, and a number of enemy ships were captured intact.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">At this time, the <span class=\"s16\">USS Landover, </span>a marine transport in orbit around Joia V was tragically destroyed. Supposedly in a secure area, the <span class=\"s16\">Landover </span>was proceeding to unload its last group <span class=\"s9\">of </span>marines on the planet&#39;s surface. The Fourth Marine Regiment, affectionately  referred to by its men as</p><p style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: -38pt;text-align: justify;\">ihe Fighting Fourth&quot;, were being garrisoned on the world in a precautionary measure against any possible Klingon incursion.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s16\">USS Landovets </span>frigate escort was successfully lured from the system <span class=\"s19\">by </span>a Klingon-executed picket passing tac­ tic, leaving the transport alone and essentially undefended. Shortly thereafter, the Ninety-First Klingon Cruiser Squad­ ron, accompanied by the Eighty-First Transport Group, warped in-system a destroyed the <span class=\"s16\">Landover, </span>killing its entire crew. Unfortunately, the officers <span class=\"s9\">of </span>the Fourth Regi­ ment were in a reconvened strategy session aboard the ship, after having seen to the safe transport of the unit&#39;s enlisted personnel to the planet&#39;s surface. <span class=\"s36\">As </span>a result of this sneak attack, command of the Fourth Marine Regiment was thrust upon Master Sergeant Randall Robar-Wheeler, its senior non-commissioned officer.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">Only hours later, the Klingon transports landed soldiers, leaving Robar-Wheeler to face their attacks without any superiors or assistance in strategy. The battle did not go well for the Fourth Marine Regiment, whose members split up to continue fighting a subversive, indirect­ tactics war until relieved months later. Master Sergeant Robar-Wheeler survived the conflict and was instrumental in tying down several crack units of the Klingon armed forces throughout much of the war. Because <span class=\"s9\">of </span>his fine effort in an almost impossible situation, he was later promoted to Lieutenant, First Class, and officially given command of a company in the Fourth Regiment.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">As ships improved, older vessels were taken out of duty for the safety of their crews. In Stardate  1/9512, the <span class=\"s16\">Sawyer </span>Class scout ended its operational life and was removed from active service. The scout had proved in­ effective for  all wartime assignments  save convoy  escort</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p style=\"padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">duties deep within safe Federation space. New ships, es­ pecially destroyers, were being continuously manufactured.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">With dozens of planets suitable for occupation and a</p><p style=\"padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -3pt;text-align: justify;\">·very limited number of fully-trained combat ground troops on each side, there were comparatively few confrontations between soldiers <span class=\"s9\">of </span>the Klingon Empire and Federation marines. Stardate 1/9601 saw the first major confrontation between opposing ground forces in the Battle of Sinbad IV,</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p style=\"padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">a planet within Federation space.   When Star Fleet In­ telligence learned <span class=\"s9\">of </span>the Klingons&#39; intentions to seize that world&#39;s resources, the Second, Eighth, and Thirteenth Mar­ ine regiments were rushed to <span class=\"s9\">its </span>defense.  <span class=\"s9\">As </span>the Klingon transport  escort  entered  the  area,  one  local  support squadron of Federation frigates intercepted.  Even though the  Klingons were  using a variation <span class=\"s9\">of  </span>convoy  baiting techniques, the second defensive squadron was in a Delta­ Z mode, waiting for the Klingons to close in. Seeing no star­ ship opposition, the Klingons unloaded their soldiers and started to provide ground support.  At that point, the Fed· eration squadron jumped the transports, causing the entire Klingon task force to execute a scattered defense.   Not pursuing as the Klingons expected, the Federation retained sole possession of the Sinbad system.  With orbital sup­ port, UFP marines killed, wounded, or captured a total of 30,000 highly-skilled Klingon ground troops,  including a crack  Klingon  Imperial Guards  battalion,  in a stunning victory.</p><p class=\"s36\" style=\"padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;\">As <span class=\"p\">strategic initiative fluctuated briefly between the UFP and the Klingon Empire, the Battle of Delgon-R saw the</span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">first use of gravitic mines. Using a small number of modffied <span class=\"s16\">D-16 </span>destroyers as minelaying ships, the Klingons estab­ lished a thin line of these devices <span class=\"s9\">in </span>an area <span class=\"s9\">of </span>open space where they expected a Federation counter-attack. Star Fleet commanders were caught <span class=\"s19\">by </span>surprise, and several <span class=\"s16\">Achemar </span>Class. cruisers from the Forty-Seventh Assault Squadron were obliterated before a tactical withdrawal could be accomplished. •</p><p style=\"padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">With the introduction of this new weapon, the Klingon forces were having some difficulty in completely securing the extensive inroads made into Federation territory. This defensive maneuver was unusual for the Klingons, who prefer the military offensive.

Still.

There. strategic squadrons numbering over 100 ships per side met in the largest fleet engagement yet. Federation forces. under the command of Admiral Brakux, split up as part of a prearranged withdrawal and regrouping maneuver. At Falgor, a three-ship task force enoou.ntered a single Klingon <i>L-68  </i>frigate  and suffered severe damage. This served as a painful ·reminder that not all Klingon ships were inferior in one-on-one combat situations.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">Vulcan Captain Sogon. commanding a squadron of <span class=\"s16\">Loknar </span>frigates, proved that logical. normally peaceful beings could succesafully wage war. <span class=\"s9\">if  </span>necessary.

After due consideratton. they decided on Star­ date 1/9603 to withdraw <span class=\"s19\">the </span><span class=\"s16\">Constitution </span>Class cruiser from front-line combat. thus preventing its military and tech­ nological secrets from being unduly risked in combat. To prevent a propaganda victory for the Klingons. the official story at that time. indicated that the <span class=\"s16\">Constitution </span>Class needed additional trial time. The official story was  not widely accepted as factual • to the Public Relations Office&#39;s chagrin.

But shortages of supplies, combined with lack of rein­ forcements and chaotic organization, eliminated any Kling­ on hopes for additional widespread advancement. -In addition, new Star Fleet ships, skilHully commanded by battle-tested officers, were now available in sufficient numbers to permit the Federation numerical superiority in certainvital sectors.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">At this point, senior Klingon officers saw their worst logistical fears confirmed, as supplies and a need for front­ line repair  facilities became more important than sheer numbers of combat vessels. Seeing their chances dwindle, officials  <span class=\"s9\">of  </span>the  Klingon  Imperial  Navy  ordered  two  final</p><p style=\"padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;\">military thrusts.

With  most of these  asteroids  containing high</p><p style=\"padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;\">percentages  of  metals, the <span class=\"s15\">,og </span>of  war•  grew  thick.    <span class=\"s9\">It</span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">became difficult for either side to detect enemy starshlps among the metallic debris that impeded lines of fire and generated false sensor readings.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">When the Battle of Thranstor was finally over, more than 100 warships were permanently disabled, and nearly as many more were seriously damaged.

Though not quite as harrowing as its counterpart, this battle was an uncomplieated, head-to­ head confrontation between fleets from both sides.</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p style=\"padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 23pt;text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s75\">The </span>Klingon thrust toward Adhara met Federation ships at Thranstor, which was  selected as a major Fed­ eration shipbuilding facility for  the future. The Battle of Thranstor involved the use <span class=\"s19\">of </span>six full battle forces of Klingon cruisers, including the greatly-respected <i>K-10 </i>and <i>K-20. </i>The Federation, however, was also well represented, with over 170 <span class=\"s12\">Tikopai, Loknar, </span>and <span class=\"s12\">Larson </span>Class cruisers, frigates, and destroyers.

The Klingon fleet that was travelling toward Star Base 15 was in a <span class=\"s9\">sorry </span>state. Aside from the new, mys­ terious <span class=\"s16\">K-238, </span>many of the enemy ships, <span class=\"s19\">including </span>older <span class=\"s12\">D- </span>7s and <span class=\"s39\">D-48 </span>pressed into service, had not been repaired</p><p style=\"padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">from previous conflicts. Numerous odd formations were the result of attempts to protect the damaged shield generator or weapons system areas <span class=\"s19\">of </span>individual ships. One entire squadron <span class=\"s19\">of </span>Klingon <span class=\"s16\">D-7A </span>cruisers went into <span class=\"s8\">battle  </span><span class=\"s16\">in reverse, </span>because their damaged front deflector shields had not yet been repaired.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">Needless to.say, the Klingons were defeated. Federation losses were light, and Argelius never saw hostile combat or heard the sound <span class=\"s19\">of </span>disruptors.

Federation forces won the majority, inflicting casualties greater than those suffered. <span class=\"s36\">As </span>starship production of the <span class=\"s16\">Poltsmith, </span>the new <span class=\"s16\">Chariot </span>Class transport, <span class=\"s9\">and </span>other major classes continued, the tide <span class=\"s19\">of </span>the war definitely shifted in the Federation&#39;s favor, with numerous Klingon task forces re­ treating.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">This was confirmed <span class=\"s9\">by </span>the totally unexpected capture of Klingon Admiral Komex. Travelling in a <i>K-170 </i>scout from the rapidly changing front to the Klingon fleet forming at Grank, Komex&#39; unescorted ship was intercepted by the <span class=\"s16\">USS Aramis, </span>a Federation destroyer on picket duty. Komex opened hailing frequencies and asked to speak with &quot;the highest-ranking available official with Star Fleet&quot;. Unsure of whether it might <span class=\"s9\">be </span>a trick, the <span class=\"s16\">Aramis </span>boarded the smaller ship and took it in tow before contacting Admiral Devon aboard the <span class=\"s16\">USS Aquila, </span>one of the <span class=\"s16\">Cygnus </span>Class command couriers used by Star Fleet as mobile operations centers.</p><p style=\"padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">Komex announced that the Klingon Empire could not win this war. He realized the war must end as soon as possible to allow his government&#39;s armed forces to rebuild and fight again at another time. Through a convoluted chain of logic not easily understood (even by Vulcans), he swore he was acting in the best interests of the Klingon Empire as</p><p class=\"s35\" style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;\">ht <span class=\"p\">described the location and defenses  around  Kolm-an,</span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">the main center of Klingon operations. After confirming as many <span class=\"s9\">of  </span>Komex&#39; facts as possible, Star Fleet decided to take him seriously and made  preparations for Operation Argus Redoubt, a full-scale attack against the Klingon stronghold.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: justify;\">Meanwhile, in Stardates 1/9711 and 1/9712, the ef-</p><p style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">forts to develop new weapons finally paid off. Engineers at Loraxial Ltd. and HiBeam Energies, Ltd. developed the photon torpedo and phaser, respectively. Both weapons were rushed into production, with warships being removed temporarily from duty to hJJve the new systems installed. Though this filled all operational Star Bases and space <span class=\"s34\">docks to </span>overflowing, the effort proved well worth it.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">Plana had already been made to conduct a marine assault <span class=\"s9\">against </span>the Klingon planet Karag. After leatning of the Klingon fleet&#39;s presence at Grank, a second plan designed for concerted attacks against both targets was <span class=\"s34\">prepared.</span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">On Stardate 1/9802.05, UFP Marines landed at Karag, where enormous numbers of Klingons and vast quantities of supplies were stored for the conflict. In the largest marine operation of the war, five full regiments were transported to the battlefields of Karag. By this time, the Vulcan Science Academy had developed a hypospray antidote to chlor­ theragen, giving Federation forces protection from that noxious, uncivilized poison. Once there, however, difficult atmospheric conditions prevented orbiting Federation sup­</p><p style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;\">port squadrons from providing assistance. The marines were <span class=\"s19\">left </span><span class=\"s34\">to </span>fend for themselvee.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">Because of <span class=\"s34\">this, </span>the battle· went badly. Karag ·pro­ duced more than its&#39; share&#39;°f UFP heroes, as Marine Corps Command personnel took on Klingon soldiers in numerous engagements. <span class=\"s19\">The </span>marines were forced to scrounge for weapons power packs and, at some points, even conduded hand-to-hand combat with the dreaded enemy.  The actions</p><p style=\"padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">of one man, Colonel Anchar Ahab of the Twelfth Marine Regiment (commonly called he Yellow Demons&quot;) stood out among the  rest.   While trying to open a pass through a</p><p style=\"padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -3pt;text-align: justify;\">·strongly-held range <span class=\"s9\">of </span>mountains, Ahab&#39;s entire force became trapped between the difficult terrain and the intense Klingon small-arms fire blocking his approach. On the other side of the mountains, a force of 10,000 marines faced hundreds of thousands of Klingon natives. Retreat through the mountain pass was their only <span class=\"s9\">hope of </span>evacuation.</p><p style=\"padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 23pt;text-align: justify;\">After locating an <i>S-3A </i>shuttlecraft, a portable laser cannon, and a photon mortar, Ahab asked for a slngle volunteer to pilot the small ship while he conducted a fire support mission from the shuttle&#39;s open door. Once he had his piot, Ahab strapped himseH inside the shuttle. While holding the very heavy and awkward· cannon, he suc­ cessfully directed the pilot toward their target and, despite numerous evasive maneuvers, knocked out the Klingons&#39; mountain defense post. This freed up the pass, and the marines were evacuated without casualty. Weather con­ ditions finally improved, giving Star Fleet&#39;s orbiting ships a chance to provide overwhelming superiority to their comrades on the surface, culminating in a hard-fought but successful victory. Star Fleet later named a medal after the series of ground battles fought on this planet. Colonel Ahab was the first to receive this new medal, called the Karagite Order.of Heroism.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 28pt;text-align: justify;\">On Stardate 1/9802.28, Star Fleet moved into the vicinity of Grank where the Klingon fleet wa$ reforming. A task force of previously-captured Klingon ships, now manned by volunteer crews from Federation worlds, was the first squadron to move in. The Klingons mistook them for re­ inforcements and remained at a low state <span class=\"s9\">of </span>alert. Using a diverse combination of tactics, more than 200 Federation ships (some already re-equipped with the new photon torpedoes) executed an enormous multiple-flank <span class=\"s34\">attack </span>against a quiescent and unprepared Klingon fle·et <span class=\"s19\">of </span>almost equal size.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">Surprise was almost total, and the new torpedoes proved their superiority over the older accelerator cannon. Klingon ships were destroyed or disabled before they could fire a shot. Kugor, the senior Klingon Admiral present, attempted to rally his forces, J)ersonally berating many· of his subordinate commanders via subspace radio. Most of them, however, had had enough, <span class=\"s9\">and </span>elements from several squadrons surrendered. Many Klingon ships fled, exe­ cutJng a ragged starburst defense. It took Star Fleet.sev­ eral months to finally track down all the escaping vessels. A few Klingon ships responded with unbounded ferocity, often conducting suicidal attacks. Some <span class=\"s19\">of </span>the most deadly ship-to-ship combats fought during the war occurred In this battle. As with the Battle of Karag, this conflict resulted in the creation of another Star Fleet combat award, the Grankite Order of Tactics commendation -</p><p style=\"padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 23pt;text-align: justify;\">The last battle of the war, Operation Argus Redoubt, was fought in Stardate 1/9803 at Kolm&quot;.&#39;an, using the detailed information provided by Admiral Komex.

The Treaty of Axanar was signed on Stardate 1/9806. 13, and its terms carried out from Stardate 1/9807 through 119904, including the escorted mass evacuations of sevral Klingon worlds in what was now declared neutral space.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">Several classes of ships, no longer needed by Star Fleet, were decommissioned or destroyed at the Centauri and Arcturas Test Ranges.

From this Stardate (1/9509.07) on, all privately-operated starships are banned from travelling with­ in the newly-created Zone of Transport Escort unless travelling In convoys. These convoys will be escorted by Star Fleet vessels to assure the safe transportation of goods, especially materials vital to the war effort. Vio­ lations of this new mandate will <span class=\"s8\">be </span>punished by confiscation of the vessel and imprisonment of the registered owner or merchant who failed to comply.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 26pt;text-align: left;\">I confess to having mixed feelings  about all this.   I have   to   resent   military   authority   intervening   in  the essentially non-military job of interstellar commerce.   I do, however, recognize the need for protection <span class=\"s19\">of </span>some kind. My merchant  line has already  lost three ships operating near the  Klingon Empire&#39;s border, including a brand-new <i>Eagle </i>Class starliner.   I certainly cannot afford to sustain any more losses without being crippled financially.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 26pt;text-align: justify;\">This enormous Zone roughly divides the Federation in two, using New Paris and Daran V as a baseline. Every starship travelling on the Klingon side of that demarcation line (which affects more than half of my shipping) must be escorted. This effectively limits ship destinations and departure times to the whim of local Star Fleet squadron commanders or availability of escorting vessels. Profits will</p><p style=\"padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s19\">be </span>drastically <span class=\"s36\">cut </span>and speculation becomes impractical, due</p><p class=\"s19\" style=\"padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;\">to  <span class=\"p\">the  uncertainty  of  ships  reaching  their  desired  des­ tinations.</span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 26pt;text-align: justify;\">Still, one has to give high-ranking Federation officials credit for their willingness to shoulder the enormous extra burden. And they were clever when they named the Zone of Transport Escort, which is less politically explosive than calling it a &quot;Free Trade Interdict&quot;. Many private traders specializing in smuggling and illegal trade will naturally find these new constrictions most confining, but it should greatly decrease the likelihood of Federation merchants being used as enemy agents. Ido wonder how much Star Fleet&#39;s action in establishing this Zone was motivated by military common sense and how much <span class=\"s9\">by </span>political concerns.</p><p class=\"s53\" style=\"padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 116pt;text-indent: -38pt;text-align: left;\">TRADE  AND COMMERCE: A  CRITICISM</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s12\" style=\"padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">Dsath of Fres Entsrpr/ss, Leo Francis Walsh.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">When war broke out with the Klingon Empire, independent merchants hoped there would be less harassment by Federation ships concerning the enforce­ ment·of petty rules and regulations. (After all, anyone studying history learns quickly that governments do more to stifle the principles of free trade and mercantilism than any other single force, competition included.)</p><p style=\"padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 26pt;text-align: justify;\">Too bad that is not what happened. Things were fine for the first few months of the war when starships manned by customs officers were totally occupied with protecting Federation space. This left them no time to pester simple and honest merchants like me with such tedious and easily forgettable details as flight plan documents and navi­ gational space-lane clearances. Even trade with the Orions increased dramatically, and all private ships were pressed into service to transport crucial war materials throughout Federation space.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 26pt;text-align: justify;\">When shipping losses from private and commercial vessels began to rise dramatically, none of the Star Fleet bigwigs could understand what was happening. Official sta­ tistics were not forthcoming, but Iwas told ships were failing to reach their destinations at a rate <span class=\"s19\">of </span>0.37% per mt&gt;nth. To Star Fleet, this was an unacceptably high rate. For every 1,000 starships, 37 would never reach their destination.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 26pt;text-align: justify;\">Although this information was not public knowledge, resourceful traders like yours truly often hear rumors that others might miss. How the vessels were being destroyed or <span class=\"s9\">by </span>whom was unknown. I happen to think it was the Orions. They are sneaky enough to try and eliminate their competition.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 26pt;text-align: justify;\">Anyway, once this started happening, the Federation slapped down  an arbitrary and almost unprecedented quarantine on private ships operating in the vicinity of either the Klingon or Romulan borders. Not that I would ever approach the Romulan border, anyway. They are not terribly friendly, even to likable fellows like me, and have less sense of humor than a Vulcan kivas trader.</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p style=\"padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Thia &quot;Zone <span class=\"s19\">of </span>Transport Escorr, as they so humorously called it, resulted in the severest repression of traders&#39; rights in the history <span class=\"s19\">of </span>the United Federation of Planets. All private ships had to carry armed space marines <span class=\"s34\">aboard, </span>had <span class=\"s19\">to </span>have flight plans filed with the nearest Star Base, <span class=\"s34\">had </span>to coordinate their flights with Federation warships, and finally, all non-Star Fleet flights to the Rigel system were off-limits, period.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 25pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;\">To put it mildly, <span class=\"s8\">I </span>found the situation alternately enraging and frustrating. Quite naturally, a common port of</p><p style=\"padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">call for my ship was Rigel <span class=\"s8\">VIII, </span>where I conducted many profitable exchanges. Now, with this oppressive new reg­ ulation, <span class=\"s8\">I</span>would not <span class=\"s34\">be </span>able to exercise my rights to free</p><p style=\"padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">trade In my area of expertise: small, exotic luxury goods. I mean, does anyone realize how unpopular a merchant with a squad <span class=\"s9\">of </span>marines as escort would be in certain sections of Rralrark?</p><p style=\"padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 26pt;text-align: justify;\">Lodging a formal protest was useless, and one particular starship commander even had the audacity to threaten confiscation of my ship when certain illegal goods were mysteriously found in my cabin. <span class=\"s8\">I, </span>of course, was in­ nocent, <span class=\"s27\">but </span>try telling that to one of those thick-skulled Star Fleet customs offlC8rs. The last years of the Four Years War were perhaps the most boring Ihave ever spent. With a war on, you&#39;d think they would have had something better to do than keep watch over me. Iwould have been willing to take my chances with the Klingons or anyone who might be pirating private merchantmen. <span class=\"s8\">If </span>Icould survive our side, I could <span class=\"s8\">probably </span>have survived <span class=\"s16\">anything.</span></p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s37\" style=\"padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;\">THE ROMULAN FACTOR</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s12\" style=\"padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;\">Intelligent»  Ana,,.,.  of  <span class=\"s41\">th•  </span>Romu/an  Star  Em­ <span class=\"s18\">pire, Volume XX/I, Star </span><span class=\"s17\">Fleet </span><span class=\"s16\">Intelligence Command, Romulan </span><span class=\"s36\">Sedor.</span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 25pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: justify;\">To date (Stardate <span class=\"s34\">1/9508.27), </span>activity along the Romulan border has been reasonably quiet, with <span class=\"s15\">no </span>Romulan ships detected in the Neutral Zone for a number of</p><p style=\"padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s35\">weeks. </span>Though losses are reaching critical levels in other areas <span class=\"s9\">of </span><span class=\"s36\">space, </span>particularly near Rigel, losses <span class=\"s19\">of  </span>shipping</p><p style=\"padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">near the Romulan Neutral Zone have been customarily light, generally attributable to non-combatant accidents or mishaps.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 25pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;\">From Stardate <span class=\"s34\">119502.10 </span>to the present time, there have been frequent, fleeting contacts with Romulan ships.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: justify;\">In that time, a Romulan scout entered the Neutral Zone and was picked up <span class=\"s19\">by </span>an automated, zone-intrusion detection sateHlte. <span class=\"s19\">Of </span>a previously unknown design, it was confirmed <span class=\"s38\">u</span>Romulan after a warp-train spectroanalysia.

Nor has there been any evidence to indicate a Romulan attack against the Klingon Empire, another old  rival. There is no doubt the senior officers <span class=\"s9\">of </span>the Romolan Imperial Navy  are aware of the current war betweenthe UFP and the Klingon Empire.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">It seems likely that the Romulans will elect to enter into hostilities with either the Federation or the Klingons before the war is over. Such an act might <span class=\"s19\">be </span>construed as implying an alliance with one power over another, but it is more likely the Romulans would be motivated by the desire to te81 new ships or equipment, or to make territorial advances  against their opposition.

dilithium crystals from Wendell Herzog, a geophysicist currently stationed at the mining complex on Rigel XII. Wend and I have been friends for a long time, and I am deeply indebted to him for sending the information and samples directly to me, without adhering to proper protocol or administrative procedures.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 27pt;text-align: justify;\">Having been involved in starship design for a number of years, Ihave seen numerous advances made, including the remarkable materializer that entered widespread service just weeks ago. Nevertheless, the potential of these di­ lithium crystals exceeds anything I have ever seen before. Without exaggeration, there is no doubt they will revo­ lutionize interstellar travel as much as Cochrane&#39;s original theory on warp travel.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 26pt;text-align: justify;\">These stones, with their peculiar and unique crystalline structure, can store energy from matter/anti­ matter reactions to be released after a critical level of charge <span class=\"s36\">is </span>reached. By focusing and storing this energy until</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p style=\"padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">the moment of discharge, higher levels of reaction can <span class=\"s34\">be </span>maintained, and the overall efficiency of the warp engine be doubled or more.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 26pt;text-align: justify;\">The importance of this is simple. Without these crystals, the maximum speed attainable with conventional warp powerplants has already been reached, approximately Warp 4.8. With them, it will be possible to reach Warp 7 or greater. There will be comparable effects on all other ship- board systems as well. Dilithium will provide more efficient use of anti-matter, increasing the available power for the ship&#39;s entire operation. In essence, it will accomplish what the <i>Tritium </i>with its three warp nacelles tried and failed to do.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 27pt;text-align: justify;\">Larger starships designed for higher energy consumption can and will be built. These new vessels will be equipped with more powerful deflector shields, weaponry, and sensors, easily able to outperform any starship not so equipped. In fact, it may even be possible to improve on ship&#39;s lasers by boosting the photic qualities of the beam through heterodyning across selected bands of the eledromagnetic spectrum.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 26pt;text-align: justify;\">These estimates may seem over-optimistic, but Iwill stand by them until there is reason to believe otherwise. Incidentally, I cannot wait to get back to my architectural computer. Ican only hope, for the sake of peace, that the Federation is the first to utilize these new crystals for use as power rectifiers aboard interstellar craft.</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s85\" style=\"padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">-------THE CONSEQUENCES-------</p><p class=\"s37\" style=\"padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 110pt;text-indent: 30pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;\">ADV ANCES  IN MILITAR Y TECHNOLOGY</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s12\" style=\"padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;\">From  Encyc/op«l/a  of  Spat»fllght,  R.

This was no less true on a Federation-wide level as a result <span class=\"s9\">of </span>the Four Years War.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">Almost all UFP warships had been equipped with dilithium-moderated warp drive nacelles before the Four Years war started. By the war&#39;s end, all warships, almost all commercial transports, passenger liners, and freighters, and many private warp-driven ships were thus equipped. This increased the overall speed and efficiency of inter­ stellar commerce.  The overall efficiency of impulse and de­</p><p style=\"padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;\">flector shields was improved as well, with much of the credit going indirectly to the new, enhanced <span class=\"s36\">warp </span>drive.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">In addition, Star Fleet began developing some of the basic theory needed for the vastly superior transwarp drive during the Four Years War. Facts such as load/stress capabilities, maximum engine operating temperatures, and other scientific information invaluable for designing the new propulsion system were gathered from test stations operating at the Arcturus and Centauri Test Ranges and from starships returning from battle-stressed conditions. Based on findings from interstellar probes and theoretical research, a complete report was concluded one year after the war ended. It confirmed the validity of the transwarp theory and opened the way for the design of the <span class=\"s16\">Excelsior </span>and other ships like it.</p><p style=\"padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">The transporte,·, developed almost <span class=\"s15\">two </span>decades before the war, entered widespread use as a weapon for the first time during the Four Years War. Star Fleet needed a rapid method for the transportation of large numbers of marines to planetary surfaces and other ships. Until the time of the Four Years War, only the standard six-man transporter was in wide use within the Federation. The greater effectiveness of the larger transporter systems on Klingon assault ships led to an intensive research project. Federation engineers made necessary modifications, resulting in the development of the now-common 22-cell transporter. This new transporter unit permitted de­ barkation of marine personnel with unprecedented speed,</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s86\" style=\"text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;\">- <span class=\"s35\">      </span><span class=\"s79\">- </span></p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"/><p class=\"s15\" style=\"padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 207pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;\">;..!)            <span class=\"s29\">D ;</span></p><p class=\"s88\" style=\"padding-left: 186pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s87\">                 &#39;- </span>-  <span class=\"s89\">- - </span><span class=\"s47\">- </span>-  <span class=\"s89\">- - </span><span class=\"s90\">- </span><span class=\"s91\">_ </span><span class=\"s92\">...                                   </span></p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p style=\"padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">greatly  enhancing their  shock  potential  for  rapid  strike missions.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">The photon torpedo was designed expressly to replace the aging, and increasingly ineffective, accelerator cannon. The accelerator cannon, essentially a high­ powered mass driver, was the primary Federation shipboard missile system through the first half <span class=\"s9\">of </span>the Four Years War. The introduction <span class=\"s9\">of </span>Klingon ships such as the <span class=\"s16\">D-9, D-10, </span>and <span class=\"s12\">D-20 </span>cruisers, equipped with KSF and KSJ deflector shields, demonstrated the need for a more powerful weapon.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">Star Fleet&#39;s Engineering Commancf placed top priority on designing a more effective shipboard missile system, powerful enough to defeat the newer Klingon shields, yet not requiring large amounts of operating energy like the laser. They made slow progress until a research team from Loraxial Ltd. headed by Priscilla Feddric provided the means to magnetically contain small amounts of antimatter. This breakthrough provided the means to construct small torpedoes or missiles of tremendous power. A launch system was quickly developed and tested at the Arcturus Test Range. Using the M-2 computer as the guidance system for the weapon, extended range and accuracy were finally obtained. The system was finally pronounced ready for operation in Stardate 1/9711. It went immediately into production, and the new system reached front-line ships before hostilities ended.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">The last major technological development was the invention of the phaser. At the outbreak of the War, scientists involved in laser research had been on the verge of a new discovery. In experimenting with all types of energy beams, Warren Shillinge of HiBeam Energies, Ltd. had discovered a way to &quot;phase energy pulses&quot;, as he described the technique. The process, now named phaser, was vigorously explored at HiBeam. Further secret re­ search developed heat, disintegrate, disrupt, and stun settings for the new weapon system. Early models were placed into production in 1/94, but these at times did more damage to Star Fleet ships than to the Klingons.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">Further development and use of the M-1 computer as a guidance and control system produced the FH-3. Use of this weapon turned the tide of war in favor of the Federation. In early 1197, the FH-3 became part of most fleet inventories, a major contribution to Star Fleet victories of that time.</p><p class=\"s37\" style=\"padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 121pt;text-indent: -26pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;\">CONSEQUENCES  FOR  MILITAR Y SHIPBUILDING   THEOR Y</p><p style=\"padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><span class=\"s45\" style=\" background-color: #000;\">POSTW AR   UFP/KLINGON  RELATIONS</span></p><p class=\"s12\" style=\"padding-left: 339pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;\">Non-mathematical  summaJ)&#39;  from  Th• Soclologlcal  <span class=\"s8\">,</span></p><p class=\"s12\" style=\"padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;\">From  Encyclopfldla  of  Spat»Rlght,  R.

Having learned what to expect from Federation armament, Klingon tactics often focused on attacking the generally-unarmed aft sections of Federation vessels. Ironically, these tactics were similar  to atmos­ pheric craft tactics of the Terran 20th-century, in which aircraft would maneuver to obtain a position behind their target to increase their chances of destroying it.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 25pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;\">Though a number <span class=\"s19\">of </span><span class=\"s12\">Loknar </span>Class ships served during</p><p style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">the Four Years War, few other vessels equipped with <span class=\"s9\">aft­ </span>firing weapons systems saw combat at that time. This lesson, however, was incorporated into later designs. ,The Federation/Klingon conflict was directly responsible for the recently-designed <span class=\"s17\">Brenton </span>Class cruiser and <span class=\"s17\">Chandley </span>Class frigate.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Aside from a dramatic increase in scout ship construction between Stardate 1/80 and 1<span class=\"s34\">/92, </span>the Federation advocated the use of fewer, more powerful vessels for its Military Operations Command. The Klingons, apparently not as concerned for individual crew safety, constructed large numbers of ships. Although these were inferior In one-on-one situations, their quantity provided numerical superiority and tactical advantage.</p><p class=\"s34\" style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">The <span class=\"p\">Federation&#39;s theory of having a smaller number of larger ships met head-on with te Klingons: theory of hving a larger quantity of weaker ships. The Khngons signlficat advances into UFP territory were a direct result of their numerical superiority, comhined with then-Inadequate Fed­ eration laser armaments. As the war continued, however, the KHngona began building fewer, larger ships, while the Federation adopted the opposite policy. Before the Four Years War was finished, both sides had compromised their shipbuildingpolicies untilthey were basically the same.</span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">To this day, the question of which composition of force Is superior has not been satisfactorily resolved. Apparently, certain combat conditions exist that show the inherent advantage of large, powerful ships in small numbers, while other conditions demonstrate the advantage <span class=\"s9\">of </span>weaker ships In large numbers.</p><p class=\"s12\" style=\"padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s17\">Impact </span>of <span class=\"s93\">tm </span>Four <span class=\"s17\">Y•rs  </span>War  and  Ax•n•r  <span class=\"s94\">P•a. </span>and <span class=\"s95\">cunure </span>Mlalon• on Fflmratlon/ICllngon Dip­ <span class=\"s17\">lomacy, </span>Ambassador <span class=\"s8\">Sarel&lt; </span>of Vulcan.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">A number <span class=\"s19\">of </span>factors crucial to Federation/Klingon diplomatic relations must be examined in light of the Four Years War.

Their purpose was to meet with Klingon officials to formulate and ratify the terms and conditions for peace concludingthe Four Years War.</p><p class=\"s36\" style=\"padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 25pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;\">It <span class=\"p\">was believed to be the first time Klingons had ever</span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;\">entered into legitimate diplomatic negotiations. For a number of years, the Federation modeled diplomatic policies and documents after the political success at Axanar. Many Star Fleet officers spent short instructional tours on the planet, meeting with the various Federation delegates.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">After the establishment of an uneasy peace with the Klingon Empire, the long, gradual process of working with the Axanarians began. Caught inexorably in the myth created <span class=\"s9\">by </span>the crew of the <i>UNSS Bonaventure, </i>the natives refused to accept peace until they were allowed to have a role in the Federation. After long deliberation, the Feder­ ation Science Council decided to consider Axanar as an experimental site for sociological studies. Although  the issue raised heated debates, the Federation Supreme Assembly  unanimously  voted  to suspend  General Order</p><p style=\"padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">mber One for Axanar.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">A team of sociologists, philologists. and linguists was dispatched to Axanar to correct the cultural damage done by previous Federation visits to the world. Chartered under the provisions in Chapter XII. Articles 76 and 77 of the Articles of the Federation, this group worked loosely under the jurisdiction of Star Fleet&#39;s Office of Colonization. It be­ came known as the Axanar Culture Mission.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Their goal was to modify Axanar&#39;s current culture and governmental structure enough to make possible conventional relations with the Federation. The plan was to teach the natives about Federation law. culture, and his­ tory, and to encourage the development of more soph­ isticated forms of seH-government. Through soci91ogical group behavior modification, the people of Axanar would begin to modify many of their less desirable cultural and social characteristics, making them more acceptable.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">The group&#39;s work, while successful, has been predictably slow.

When necessary, however Klingon vessels also engaged in combat when drastically outnumbered, at times preferring racial pride and the pursuit <span class=\"s19\">of </span>posthumous glory over sound military tactics</p><p style=\"padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Klingons used a number of different formations for combat, but individual commanders often  conveniently forgot the tactical battle plan after the first few minutes of battle. Though the Klingon Empire is predominantly a structured military society, Klingon warship commanders resented having specific assignments as part of a mission. With each commander eagerly seeking honor in combat, having a rigidly detailed assignment to fulfill (particularly if it was a subordinate or defensive one) went against their desire for a quick victory and individual glory. <span class=\"s19\">As </span>a result, battle formations often deteriorated shortly after engage­ ment with an opposing task force, with each Klingon vessel engaging one-on-one against enemy vessels. The greater the number of ships involved, the more common and severe the breakdown in Klingon cohesiveness.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Also, Klingons do not particularly like  to  work together, because of the dangers in having to trust a ellow&#39; commander. This distrust, common through nearly all levels of starship command, contributed to the Klingons&#39; dif­ ficulties in effectively using the V- and U-formations. A dam­ aged Klingon ship could not depend on assistance from another Klingon vessel, and many Klingon ships crippled in battle were abandoned by their squadron-mates. h is even said a Klingon squadron commander prefers having a known enemy covering his flank or rearward positions to having a potential enemy among his own ranks.</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s53\" style=\"padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">FEDERATION TACTICS</p><p style=\"padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Star Fleet commanders serving in the Four Years War preferred working in large squadrons or groups when possible, defending strategic targets or conducting fleet actions against Klingon forces. Unfortunately, the superior numbers of Klingon warships often forced UFP units to fight in small, highly-skilled groups of three to six ships, at least duringthe early <span class=\"s52\">part </span>of the war.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">During times of peace, Federation starships do not initiate any hostile action, such as firing first or even raising shields, unless threatened. An official declaration <span class=\"s19\">of </span>war, however, suspends these gentlemanly rules of conduct. Therefore, Federation vessels in the Four Years War en­ gaged in combat after positive enemy identification was made, usually through direct, visual means. Being allowed to fire •at will•, kept the lives of Star Fleet crewmembers from being placed in undue jeopardy. Confirming the hostile Identity of opposing forces before conducting combat insured the safety of all but the enemy.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Simply put, the United Federation of Planets had three major advantages in combat:</p><ol id=\"l3\"><li style=\"padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 26pt;text-align: justify;\"><p style=\"display: inline;\">Despite the UFP&#39;s overall peaceful intents, individual Star Fleet commanders were generally better trained than their Klingon counterparts. This led to situ­ ations where sheer ship-to-ship tactical skill on the Federation&#39;s part would win battles.</p></li><li style=\"padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\"><p style=\"display: inline;\">Starship commanders worked closely together for the group&#39;s overall benefit and protection. This meant covering the weak flanks of individual ships or formations, and generally assisting each other when combat conditions became difficult.</p></li><li style=\"padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\"><p style=\"display: inline;\">By using creative tactics, including temporary tactical withdrawals and regroupings, Star Fleet forces were able to withstand and eventually neutralize the Klingons&#39; early numerical superiority in warships.</p></li></ol><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s53\" style=\"padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 58pt;text-align: left;\">SPECIAL TACTICS</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s8\" style=\"padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">V· AND U FORMATIONS</p><p style=\"padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Federation and Klingon starship commanders were trained in many <span class=\"s19\">of </span>the same basie formations through years of computer simulation and operational testing. One of these included forming a V- or U-shaped task force using three or four ships. Physically, the formations are the same. If three ships are used, it is called a V-formation, and if four ships are used, it is called a U-formation. With this formation, the center ship, usually the group&#39;s flagship, would generally be up to 40,000 km. in front of, or behind, the other ships in the formation, depending on the purpose <span class=\"s9\">of </span>the task force&#39;s mission.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s9\">If </span>the flagship was leading, the mission would probably <span class=\"s19\">be </span>a general, all-purpose attack, or to drive a wedge into the opponent&#39;s line of defending starships. The area with the strongest combined concentration <span class=\"s19\">of </span>fire would be to the port and starboard sides of the flagship&#39;s position.                                                      •</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s102\" style=\"padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;\">,</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s36\" style=\"padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">H <span class=\"p\">the flagship was trailing, the mission might be to meet in a general defensive engagement, an offensive en­ gagement  against  a  single,  more  powerful  ship,  or  to</span></p><p style=\"padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -33pt;text-align: justify;\">,.... encircle an enemy ship prior to capture. One major ad­ vantage of a trailing flagship is that the combined concen­ tration of fire <span class=\"s34\">is </span>greatest directly infront of the formation.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">The position of the flagship in Klingon-employed formations often revealed the esteem of that group&#39;s commander or the cohesiveness of that task force. If the flagship led, the commander could trust his two (or three) subordinate ship commanders, and in turn, they trusted him. If the flagship trailed, it was because the group commander knew that an ambitious ship·eommander might be willing to fire into the flagship&#39;s rear arc in order to lead the formation himself. Or, alternately, the flagship com­ mander could not be trusted, and his fellow ship commanders wanted to be able to catch him between their ships <span class=\"s19\">if </span>necessary. On more than one occasion, the flag­ ship would change its relative position within the task force just before entering battle, usually on the order of a Klingon Imperial Security officer aboard one of the ships.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">The Klingons had two different names for the V- or U­ formation, not based on the number of ships, but on the position of the flagship occupying the formation&#39;s center. If the flagship is leading, it is called &quot;oma&#39;I yuth&quot; (&quot;brave wedge&quot;), and <span class=\"s19\">if </span>the flagship is trailing, it is called &quot;hu toj maal&quot; (&quot;open mouth&quot; or &quot;mouth of fear&quot;).</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s8\" style=\"padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">STAGGERED FORMATION</p><p style=\"padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">On at least one occasion, the positional change of the Klingon flagship just before combat adversely affected the resolution of a battle. As a partial solution to their problems with the V-formation, a staggered formation was adopted and is still used by many Klingon task  forces today.</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p style=\"padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">This maneuver places the three ships in a linear, equidistant formation.  The flagship leads, the second ship is behind and to the port or starboard of the first ship, and the third ship is behind and on the same side as the second ship. <span class=\"s8\">H </span>a larger nurpber of ships is involved, a wide variety of intricate patterns are used by several  groups  of staggered ships working in the same formation. In fact, this was the formation used by the three <span class=\"s16\">D-7M </span>cruisers destroyed in the V&#39;ger incident. In that particular instance, the flagship was the center ship and not the lead ship. The Klingons call this formation &quot;juk&#39;y wen&#39;thal&quot; (&quot;ladder of assault&quot;).</p><p class=\"s8\" style=\"padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">STRAIGHT LINE FORMATION</p><p style=\"padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">The Federation used the staggered formation only on rare occasions such as in fleet reviews, as they had their own alternate to the V- and LI-formations. Theirs was a simple formation with straight line movement along the line of advance, and all ships holding equidistant positions. If larger numbers of ships were involved, parallel formations two or three ships deep might be used. Also, the flanking ships might be moved forward or aft of  the rest of the formation, causing the line of advance to be slightly curved in one direction. The· Klingons called this &quot;puk&#39;lan eden&#39;z&quot; (&quot;lizards in a line&quot;, named after a passive species of reptiles on Hruns&#39;la).</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s8\" style=\"padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">PICKET PASSING</p><p style=\"padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">A tactic called &quot;picket passing&quot; by the Federation and &quot;zhu t&#39;lan&#39;nol&quot; (&quot;thrusting the pawn&quot;) by the Klingons, was occasionally used to attack a desired target or pass through an area under surveillance. The target could be a boundary or region of space, a fixed installation, or less often, a convoy. Though used first by the Klingons, the Federation adopted it, until both sides finally caught on and the tactic lost some of its effectiveness.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">The idea was to confuse and distract the defending ships through the use of two or more attacking task forces. The first task force would move into sensor range, hopefully causing the defending ships to respond and intercept, which would lure them out of position. As long as they ful­ filled their mission as a decoy force, the first task force might not even engage the defenders in combat. This ruse allowed a second, generally much larger force to strike against the now undefended target, taking them completely by surprise.</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s8\" style=\"padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">DELTA Z MANEUVER</p><p style=\"padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">A tactic called &quot;Delta-Z maneuvering&quot; by the Federation and &quot;khas&#39;lan t&#39;waxnor&quot; (&quot;vertical claw&quot;) by the Klingons, was often used in anticipation of an attack on a planetary system. This maneuver was popular with the Fed­ eration. Klingon commanders disliked it because of its subtle and &#39;cowardly&#39; approach to warfare.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">More often than not, Klingon forces preparing to attack a planet or planetary  defense system approached along the plane of the planetary system&#39;s ecliptic, or &quot;level&quot; with the other planets, rather than coming in from &quot;above&quot; or &quot;below&quot; the targeted planet. They used this maneuver because their vessels could take cover in asteroid or cometary belts.</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p style=\"padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">When Federation forces knew a planet was coming under attack, a defending squadron took up positions far above or below (or both) the plane of the ecliptic. Coming into the system, Klingon forces might not detect the defenders, permitting those squadrons to move up or down into attack positions in the rear arc of the Klingon warships.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">A second variation used by Federation forces was to deliberately remove all warships defending a planetary system known to be a target, making it appear undefended. After Klingon forces moved in, the Federation squadron warped back in-system on several divergent courses, to make multiple flanking attacks that sometimes caught Klingon ships fatally off-guard. A somewhat risky tech­ nique, it worked more often than not. When the tactic back­ fired, however, Federation commanders were themselves caught unaware.</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s8\" style=\"padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;\">SIX O&#39;CLOCK LOW</p><p style=\"padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">A tactic called &quot;six o&#39;clock low&quot; (origin obscure) by the Federation and &quot;eddakh w&#39;ujalla&quot; (&quot;striking for the spleen&quot;) by the Klingons, was a common ship-to-ship tactic that used individual warships with forward- and aft-firing weapons systems.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Klingon ships, usually equipped with forward- and aft­ firing weapons, would deliberately leave their ships open for a flanking attack by Federation ships. As soon as the forward-firing Federation ship moved into the Klingon&#39;s rear arc, the Klingon ship unexpectedly opened fire with the rear disruptors, taking the Federation commander by surprise. This technique did not work successfully against Federation squadrons very often because many commanders quickly caught on. It was often used successfully against lone con­ voy escorts whose officers were less experienced against general Klingon tactics.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">A second variation often used by Klingons  was to move into the Federation ship&#39;s rear arc, knowing that this was often the most vulnerable area of UFP vessels. This maneuver was used throughout the war whenever con­ ditions permitted, though these conditions grew less com­ mon as the battles raged on.</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s8\" style=\"padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">CONVOY BAITING</p><p style=\"padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">A tactic called &quot;convoy baiting&quot; by the Federation and &quot;vakh to gal&quot; (&quot;glory seeker&quot;) by the Klingons involved the use of a ship or small convoy, apparently without escort. Several friendly warships would surround and maintain a parallel course with the convoy just outside sensor range. These warships left a narrow area or alley through which the enemy vessel(s) could pass. As soon as the enemy de­ tected the convoy and moved through the alley to attack, the escorting ships would also move in, catching them in a globe.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">This tactic, initially used to protect conventional wartime convoys, was later  used as a deliberate ploy to catch and possibly capture enemy warships. In these situ­ ations, the Federation often used a group of automated ore carriers or similar ships as the decoy, rather than risking the lives of crewmen. The Klingons, less concerned with lives, used a single ship manned by servitor races as the bait. <span class=\"s9\">Of </span>course, should the crew of the decoy ship attempt to break formation during the operation, the Klingon-manned escort ships destroyed it before Federation forces arrived.</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s8\" style=\"padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">SWARMING</p><p style=\"padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">A tactic called &quot;swarming&quot; by the Federation and &quot;v&#39;kari z&#39;mortamas&quot; (&quot;many stings of death&quot;) by the Klingons employed a large number of small ships, often gunboats or scouts. The attackers moved in against a smaller group of heavier Federation vessels. Making passes at the highest possible velocity, the smaller Klingon ships could direct most of their power to energizing weapons systems, and any remaining energy to defense systems. Federation ships, unable to engage the vase swarm of attackers, had to try merely to survive. Most of their vessels&#39; power had to be deployed in shield operation, which did not permit much inthe way of counter-attack.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">The technique was often suicidal for individual Klingon ships. However, the tactic&#39;s effectiveness in de­ stroying enemy ships also brought great honor to the Klingons involved. The Federation, on the other  hand, rarely used swarming. Aside from occasional groupings of <span class=\"s16\">Portsmith </span>destroyers, UFP forces rarely had enough ships in one place to use such a tactic. In any event, the Fed­ eration&#39;s high regard for the lives of starship crews all but prohibited it.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Though not seen during the Four Years War, a more recent variation of &quot;v&#39;kari z&#39;mortamas&quot; using cruisers in conjunction with  the gunboats has been successfully employed <span class=\"s52\">by </span>Admiral zantai Kaneida in the Triangle. Klingon destroyers would come in and engage opposing forces, giving the cruisers time to maneuver for best attacking positions. As the cruisers began their engagement, large numbers of gunboats would then swarm in and overwhelm the opposing ship&#39;s fire-control systems and shields. This permitted the cruisers&#39; heavy fire to easily penetrate defenses and destroy their targets, with few losses to any part of the Klingon force. No simple solution currently exists to counter this new tactical threat. One goal of the upcoming UFP TaCtical Encounters XXVI Fleet Maneuvers is to find a neutralizing maneuver that also considers the safety of Federation forces.</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><h4 style=\"padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">COCHRANE DECELERATION</h4><p style=\"padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">A tactic called &quot;Cochrane  Deceleration&quot;, after Zephram Cochrane, was used by Federation ships as a ship­ to-ship tactic to partially counter both swarming and the Klingon-executed six o&#39;clock low. This technique was even more effective when the Federation ship faced an attacking ship with greater speed and maneuverability.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">The defending Federation ship would cease all forward tactical movement. As the attacking ship came and passed by at close range, th.a Federation ship would make a stress turn, pivoting 120 degrees. While doing so, the forward shields remained at their highest state of readiness, and all possible forward weapons systems would engage the attacking target, now hopefully presenting its rear arc.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">The Cochrane Deceleration worked best if the Fed­ eration ship was near one flank of the swarm, or if the at­ tacking ship was expected to pass at high speed within accelerator cannon or photon torpedo range. The Klingons never adopted the technique because of the skill required in execution. They learned to respect it, however, calling it &quot;k&#39;yan ndar&#39;sliv&quot; (&quot;slow source of doom&quot;).</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><h4 style=\"padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">SCATTERED DEFENSE</h4><p style=\"padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Though most defensive formations are created as the tactical situation develops, the Klingons did have one tactic used to deliberately confuse and divide  large Federation forces attempting a  full-scale engagement with out­ numbered Klingon units. This defense, known as the &quot;scattered&quot; or &quot;starburst defense&quot; by the Federation and &quot;hul fal tora&#39;n&quot; (&quot;glorious exploding star&quot;) by the Klingons, was used to achieve a single-unit engagement with Federation forces, or to mislead them about the actual destination of one or more Klingon task forces. The Federation never developed any effective counter­ measure, because it involved two entirely different philosophies of combat. The only thing Federation com­ manders could do after a scattered defense was to labor­ iously track down and neutralize each Klingon ship or task force, one at atime.</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><h4 style=\"padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">OTHER FORMATIONS</h4><p style=\"padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Specialized formations, seeing limited use, were created by  both Federation and Klingon squadron com­ manders, often as circumstances dictated. These special tactics included,  but were not limited to: false ship rec­ ognition signals for deception; assorted convoy escort formations; the widespread use of decoys and gravitic mines (a Klingon specialty); tactics designed for the reduced capability of damaged ships or ships with detached command sections; tactics using available physical or astrophysical phenomena such as asteroid and cometary belts, or ion storms; and straightforward suicide tactics using ships of all sizes, from shuttlecraft up through <span class=\"s16\">Class VIII </span>cruisers.</p><p style=\"padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><span class=\"h3\" style=\" background-color: #000;\">TASK   FORCE COMPOSITIONS</span></p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p style=\"padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;\">The Klingon Imperial Navy and Star Fleet Command both designed task forces to meet the particular needs of each tactical situation. The UFP was more likely to combine different classes of ships in one group, allowing the strengths of some ships to make up for any weaknesses of the others in the force. The Klingons, because of their mu­ tual distrust, would generally have several ships of the same class in one force, or alternately, have one large ship with two to six smaller ships. This discouraged any deli­ berate acts of  coercion between ship commanders, and later in the war, would decrease some difficulties in supplying and repairing front-line vessels.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">Both sides did freely use three- and four-ship task forces. A three-ship unit was called a battle group. A battle squadron consisted of three battle groups. A battle force consisted of three battle squadrons, or a total of 27 ships. Larger assemblies were called strategic groups, squadrons, forces, and finally, fleets.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;\">The availability of specific warships, combined with the general purpose and cruising speed of those ships and their similarity for repair purposes, went a long way toward deciding which ships would be assigned together in task forces. The Klingon <span class=\"s55\">K-23A </span>escort, for example, was a small but powerful warship used for escorting convoys. Working alone or in very small numbers, the <span class=\"s55\">K-23A </span>was also designed to defend itself. The <span class=\"s55\">D-10A </span>cruiser, on the other hand, was intended for use in major  fleet actions and planetary neutralization. Similar in design to a number of other warships, the  <span class=\"s55\">D-1</span><i>DA </i>usually operated with  a sup­ porting escort of three to six <span class=\"s55\">D-16A </span>destroyers. The fact that the newer Klingon <span class=\"s55\">D-lA </span>cruiser could not cruise for extended durations at Warp 6 directly led to the selection of the <span class=\"s16\">D-4E </span>as the cruiser for the Axanar task force.</p><p style=\"text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\"><br/></p><p class=\"s20\" style=\"padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 152pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;\">•New

He violated regulations by separating himseH from his partner and refusing to answer a communicator callfor several hours.\n\nExtraa  ftom  SciMce   Officer'•   Log,   UNSS Bonaventure, Ensign Colin B. Fottine, (written Stardate DIS509.14).\nServing as science officer aboard the United Nations Space Ship Bonaventure has been a weird experience, but at least Ican modestly claim to be the best Axanarian lin­ guist in the Fleet. The people of Axanar are incredibly primitive by Earth standards (though they have a  few advanced religious beliefs remarkably inconsistent with their other areas of development). Some of the things to which Iwas exposed there turned my stomach more ·than weightle88ne88 ever wil.\nAxanarians are very much like Humans In appearance, though a little shorter and with a higher m888- to-height ratio. They are most like the Aleutian people on Earth, with their adaptation to a cold climate, including a\nthicker layer of epithelial tissue and epicanthial folds over the eyes. Their skin color is somewhat pale due to blood V88881s being deeper below the skin, the cone and rod eye cells interpret visible light differently, and internal organ arrangements are not like anything Ihave seen before, but\nthese are minor variations. It appears they evolved from something very similar to anthropoids, adapting accordingly to the harsher environment of their world.\nA war-like race organized loosely into tribes, Axanarians are openly hostile to all outsiders, successfully killing half of my eight-man contact team in an ambush. The rest of us were taken prisoner. Aa we were not searched, we were still armed. In my judgement, they could have killed us all in their surprise  attack,  and  so  Isurmised that they\nhad a reason to take captives. Ionly hoped that once we showed ourselves to be intelligent beings, at least by their standards, communication could begin and peaceful relations might follow.\nThrough a tedious process of hand gestures and one­ to-one word-action correspondence, a lingua ftanca evol­ ved. When their chief learned we carne from outside their world, he immediately made the connection to outer space, and accorded the survivors of our party a status akin to godhood. He was pleased to have our presence in his village, a loose, medieval conglomeration of vin•and.fur­ woven huts.\nSeveral weeks passed as we slowly teamed about each other. When it became neceaeary for us to leave, the chief tried to prevent  it by offering  up a number of  hil\nwarriors.      Unfortunately,   the   warriors   were   to  sacr(fice    · .­\nthemselves by suicidally attackla,g us.- Even as we stOod,\nhe ordered members of his tribe to'prepa;.. for combat.\n\n",

			"contents": "The Salvo Missile System is the only completely new weapon introduced in this book - it is either a set of launch tubes or external racks that fire groups of six relatively small anti-ship missiles, each group being termed a “salvo”. The missiles are only one-turn duration (unlike the heavier missiles in the More Thrust rules). Each SM system may fire one missile salvo each turn. There are two types of missile salvo available - “standard” SMs and Enhanced-Range (ER) SMs. Both types work in the same way, but the ER missiles have (as their name implies) a greater range than the standard types, and cost proportionally more. Missile fire occurs in the same phase as FIGHTER GROUP MOVEMENT; that is, AFTER orders are written but BEFORE ships are moved. The firing player announces that he is firing a missile salvo, and places a salvo counter at his intended point of aim - this may be anywhere up to a maximum range of 24\" from the firing ship (or 36\" for an Enhanced-Range (ER) missile salvo, but must be within the boundaries of the fire arcs through which the SM system may bear. The marker is left in place while all ships are moved; if at the END of movement there is an enemy ship within 6\" of the marker (in any direction) then the missiles will attack it; if there is more than one potential enemy target within 6\", then the salvo will go for the CLOSER of them. Move the missile salvo marker next to target ship and apply countermeasures/defences before resolving missile hits. Note that if there is no valid target within 6\" at the end of movement, the salvo is wasted and the counter removed from play. [SPECIAL NOTE: if you choose to use the VECTOR MOVEMENT system given in this book instead of the “standard” FT movement rules, then we strongly suggest reducing the attack radius of Salvo Missiles from 6\" to 3\" - this will prevent the missiles becoming too accurate against the more predictable manoeuvre envelope of a vector-movement ship. If a particular scenario calls for the mixing of vector and cinematic movement ships, then allow missiles to attack if within 6\" of a cinematic-drive ship but only within 3\" of a vector-drive ship - if you want some “PSB” to justify this, then assume that the gravdrive (cinematic movement) ships have a higher drive signature for the missiles to home on than the reaction drives of the vector-movement ships.] When resolving SM system fire, the target player must first decide what defences he is allocating against each missile salvo; after he has announced this the attacking player rolls a D6 for each salvo marker attacking - result is the number of missiles in the salvo that are actually on target. The target player then resolves defensive fire as follows: For each Point-Defence System (PDS) that is allocated to anti-missile defence roll a D6 - rolls of 4 and 5 each stop ONE missile, 6 stops TWO and allows a reroll. For each Class-1 Beam Battery or screening fighter that is allocated to anti-missile defence roll a D6 - rolls of 5 or 6 stop ONE missile (reroll on 6); 1-4 rolls have no effect. (Note that this is the roll PER FIGHTER in screening groups - so a full-strength group will roll 6 dice, killing a missile on each 5 or 6 scored.) After subtracting any missiles that are intercepted from the score that the attacker rolled, any positive number is the number of missiles that actually get through the defences AND hit the target (yes, if there are no defences at all then at least ONE missile will always get through!). For EACH missile of the salvo that reaches the target ship, roll 1 D6 - the number rolled is the number of damage points inflicted, and rolls of 6 score 6 but do NOT get a reroll. Screen systems do NOT reduce missile damage. If the target is protected by ARMOUR, then HALF of the total damage (rounded up) done by the salvo is taken on the armour, and the remainder on the hull even if there are still armour boxes left at that point. Missiles that get through the defences ARE deadly, so try and stop them if you can!! Example: two missile salvoes are fired at a single target ship. The ship has the following systems that can defend it against missile fire - one point-defence battery (PDS) and two Class-1 beam batteries that can function in a defensive role. Before he knows exactly how many missiles will actually strike home, the ship’s captain has to decide how he will allocate his defences - he chooses to use the PDS alone against one incoming salvo, and the 2 Class-1 batteries to combine fire against the second salvo. The attacking player now rolls for each of his missile salvoes; for the first he scores a miserable 2, but gets luckier with the second and rolls 5. The first salvo has only two missiles on target, and the defending player rolls his PDS die and gets a 6, thus shooting them both down (he would be allowed a reroll for the six, but there is no point as both target missiles are already hit). For the second salvo, with five missiles incoming, the defender gets to roll 2 dice for his 2 Class-1 batts, and gets a 4 and a 6 - the 6 allows him a reroll, but he only gets a 2 with it. So, he has hit only ONE incoming missile. The end result is that four missiles of the second salvo get past all the defences, and deliver their warheads in a blaze of energy - a D6 is rolled for each of them, scoring 3, 1, 3 and a lucky 6; missile hits don’t reroll 6s, so this gives a grand total of 3+1+3+6 = 13 damage points to the target ship - enough to cripple a smaller warship and cause some serious harm to even a large one. If the ship has seven boxes or more of ARMOUR, half of the total missile damage (rounded up), ie: 7 points, will be taken on the armour and the remaining 6 on the hull boxes. SALVO MISSILE MOUNTINGS AND MAGAZINES: Salvo Missile systems come in two types: reloadable launching tubes (denoted Salvo Missile Launchers, or SML) which are fed from internal missile magazines, and externally carried one-salvo launch racks (termed Salvo Missile Racks, or SMR). If SMLs are fitted to a ship, the launcher itself takes 3 MASS while each salvo load carried in the internal magazines takes up 2 MASS for standard missiles and 3 MASS for enhanced-range types. An external SMR takes 4 MASS for the complete rack including a standard missile salvo, or 5 MASS for a rack with an ER salvo. One SML may fire one salvo per turn provided ammunition is left in the magazines; one SMR may fire its salvo load at any time, but is then empty until replenished from a base or fleet auxiliary. SMRs provide the cheapest “maximum throw weight”, since every missile on the ship may be fired at the same time if desired; for extended operations, however, one or two conventional launchers backed up by a good magazine capacity is the most flexible and cost-effective solution. In general, SMRs tend to be fitted to smaller craft where the saving in mass is critical (and the ship may well not survive long enough to fire more than one or two salvoes anyway!), while SMLs and magazines are used more on larger classes which need sustained fire capability. Examples: Fitting one SMR (assuming standard missiles) takes 4 MASS, as opposed to the 5 MASS needed for an SML with the same one salvo; however, one SML with a 2-salvo magazine takes only 7 MASS against the 8 needed for a pair of SMRs - though the ship with the single SML and the magazine can only fire one salvo per turn, while the twin- SMR ship can fire both at once. As the weapon load increases, the difference becomes more significant still - if you had 40 MASS available on a very large warship you could, if desired, fit 10 SMRs and be able to deliver all ten salvoes simultaneously, but the same 40 MASS would allow you to fit (say) four SML tubes and a 14-salvo magazine to feed them. MAGAZINE CAPACITIES Missile Salvoes for SMLs take up Magazine Capacity at the rate of 2 MASS per standard salvo, and 3 per enhanced-range salvo. The MASS allocated to magazine space during a ship’s design stage may be broken down into separate magazines at the designer’s discretion, but with the following important limitation: any one Launcher system may only be fed from ONE magazine, though a single magazine may feed more than one launcher. Thus if a ship has 2 SMLs and 8 MASS of magazine space, the designer may decide to fit just a single 8-space magazine feeding both launchers, or could give each launcher its own 4-space magazine instead. The disadvantage of the single magazine is that all the SM capability could be lost with one bad threshold roll (as one magazine is rolled for as a single system, regardless of its capacity or the number of salvo loads in it); on the other hand, with two smaller magazines the player does not have to option to feed missiles to either launcher - if one launcher is lost while it still has missiles in its dedicated magazine, those missiles are useless; they cannot be fired by another undamaged launcher that was not originally fed from that magazine. The intended type of loadout is another factor to consider when installing missile magazines - in the example above, the ship with a single MASS 8 magazine could choose its loadout as 4 x standard salvoes or 1 x standard and 2 x ER salvoes (a 2 x standard and 1 x ER loadout is also allowed, but wastes 1 space in the magazine). If the same ship had 2 x MASS 4 magazines, however, carrying any ER salvoes would be much less efficient - the spare space in each magazine would be wasted. The SM Magazine icon is a box linked by lines to the SM Launcher(s) it feeds; the number of salvoes carried in the magazine is indicated by small arrowhead icons within the box, which are crossed off as they are fired. For a STANDARD SM salvo leave the arrowhead white, and for an ER salvo shade it in black. SM Launchers have a black arrowhead in the actual launcher icon, but this has no bearing on the load carried in the magazine - SM RACKS, on the other hand, have either a white or black icon according to the load carried. [Note that the ship designs in this book all assume standard salvo loads in the magazines - if you wish to load a ship with ER salvoes then shade in the required number of salvo icons and delete any unwanted ones - eg: if a ship design shows 3 standard salvo icons in a MASS 6 magazine, and you wish to use 2 ER salvoes instead, shade two icons black and cross off the third one.]",
